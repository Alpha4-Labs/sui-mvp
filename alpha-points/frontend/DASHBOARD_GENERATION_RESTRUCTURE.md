# Dashboard & Generation Page Restructure

## Overview
Major architectural restructure that aligns the Alpha Points platform with its core concept of partners bringing generation opportunities and perks. This change moves primary earning actions from the Dashboard to the Generation page, making the Dashboard focused on monitoring and performance.
