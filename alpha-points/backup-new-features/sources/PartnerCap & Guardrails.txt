Below is a developer-facing implementation plan that incorporates all new partner guard-rails (PartnerCap collateral, daily caps, weight curve, supply oracle) and aligns with Sui v1.0 / Move 2024.alpha conventions.
It assumes the current module files you provided (ledger.move, partner.move, etc.) compile on pre-1.0 Sui but need to be upgraded.

2. New Guard-Rails Implementation Detail
2.1 Daily Wallet Cap
Add to ledger
move
CopyEdit
const DAILY_WALLET_CAP: u64 = 10_000; // points
struct MintStats has key { minted_today: Table<address, u64>, last_epoch: u64 }


Reset in earn_points_by_partner() when clock.epoch > stats.last_epoch.
2.2 Weight Curve
move
CopyEdit
public fun weight(stake_secs: u64, principal: u64, liq_share: u64): u64 {
    let p = sqrt(principal); // use 0x1::math::sqrt_u64
    let t = sqrt(stake_secs);
    p * t / (1 + liq_share)
}


Call inside ledger::mint to bound pts minted ≤ weight.
2.3 Global Inflation Oracle
Add struct struct SupplyOracle has key { total_pts: u128, redeem_rate: u64 }
 Update in ledger::mint and ledger::burn; every epoch recompute:
nginx
CopyEdit
if total_pts > last_total * 105% { redeem_rate += 1 bps }


Return redeem_rate to redemption functions.
________________


3. Migration Checklist to Sui v1.0
* Replace ID → UID in all structs.

* Update use 0x1::vector to use sui::vector alias.

* Switch Option<T> to 0x1::option::Option<T> or sui::option.

* Use new signer::assert_addr_owns() where appropriate instead of manual checks.

* Re-generate documentation with sui move doc.

________________


4. Partner Integration Example (TypeScript SDK 1.x)
ts
CopyEdit
import { TransactionBlock } from "@mysten/sui.js/transactions";


export async function mintPoints(
  user: string,
  pts: number,
  partnerCap: string,
  suiClient: SuiClient
) {
  const tx = new TransactionBlock();
  tx.moveCall({
    target:
      "0x<PKG>::integration::earn_points_by_partner",
    arguments: [
      tx.pure(user),
      tx.pure(pts),
      tx.object(partnerCap),
      tx.pure(/* option::none<StakePosition> */ 0),
      tx.object("0x2::clock::Clock"),
      tx.object("0x<PKG>::ledger::LEDGER_ID")
    ],
  });
  return wallet.signAndExecuteTransactionBlock({ transactionBlock: tx });
}


-No backend; front-end signs the Move call.

	________________


Bottom Line
With these upgrades, Alpha4's Move package will be fully Sui v1.0 compliant and offer partners a no-backend, spam-resistant path to integrate points.
 The development path is incremental, leans on on-chain math and collateral objects, and preserves all the new guard-rail features we brainstormed.

Post-Build Functional Alignment - Action Plan

After achieving a successful build, the following items were identified during a functional review against this document. They need to be addressed to ensure full alignment with intended functionality and guardrails.

**Priority 1: Critical Fixes & Core Functionality**

1.  **`oracle.move` - Implement `is_stale` Function (Critical STUB)**
    *   **Task:** Replace the `return false;` stub in `is_stale` with actual logic to compare `clock_epoch - oracle.last_update_epoch` against `oracle.staleness_threshold`.
    *   **Impact:** Ensures oracle data is not used if outdated, critical for financial correctness.

2.  **`partner.move` - Collateral-Based Quota Initialization (Major Missing Feature)**
    *   **Task:** Modify `grant_partner_cap` (or create a new permissionless function like `create_and_initialize_partner_cap` if `grant_partner_cap` is to remain admin-only for other reasons).
        *   The function should accept a `Coin<C>` (where `C` is an accepted collateral type, e.g., `SUI` or a stablecoin).
        *   It should take a `RateOracle` to get the price of `C` (likely in USDC or a base currency).
        *   Calculate `collateral_value_usdc = coin::value<C>(&collateral_coin) * oracle_price_of_C_in_usdc`.
        *   Determine `daily_quota_pts` based on this `collateral_value_usdc` (e.g., a fixed ratio, or tiered).
        *   Store `collateral_value_usdc` (or the original collateral amount and type) and the computed `daily_quota_pts` in the `PartnerCap`.
        *   The `PartnerCap` should be transferred to the `tx_context::sender(ctx)`.
    *   **Note:** Ensure this creation/initialization is permissionless as per user request (not gated by `AdminCap` or `GovernCap` beyond standard object creation rules). If `grant_partner_cap` is intended for admin use, a new function is needed.
    *   **Impact:** Implements the core "collateralized partner cap" feature.

**Priority 2: Key Logic & Parameter Refinements**

3.  **`ledger.move` - Define `liq_share` for Weight Curve**
    *   **Task:**
        *   Determine how `liq_share` (liquidity share, for the `1/(1+L)` part of the weight formula) should be calculated or sourced.
        *   Update `ledger::mint_points` and its callers (e.g., in `integration.move`) to pass the correct `liq_share` value instead of the current hardcoded `0`. This might involve fetching data from another module or a config object.
    *   **Impact:** Correctly implements the weight curve formula.

4.  **`ledger.move` - `SupplyOracle` Refinements**
    *   **Task A (Epoch Tracking):** Add `last_recompute_epoch: u64` to the `SupplyOracle` struct. Initialize it and update it within `recompute_redeem_rate_if_needed`.
    *   **Task B (Role of `redeem_rate`):** Clarify and document the precise role of `SupplyOracle.redeem_rate`. If it's a global redemption rate, how does it interact with the asset-specific `oracle::RateOracle`? If it's an additional fee/modifier, ensure this is clear and correctly applied in redemption functions.
    *   **Impact:** Ensures `SupplyOracle` functions correctly and its purpose is clear.

5.  **`integration.move` - `StakePosition<u8>` in `earn_points_by_partner`**
    *   **Task:**
        *   Review the use of `StakePosition<u8>` and `ledger::mint_points<u8>(...)` within `internal_earn_points_by_partner_logic`.
        *   If points earned via this method are not tied to a specific staked asset type `T`, determine the correct "marker" type to use instead of `u8`. This might involve defining a new phantom type like `struct PartnerEarned;` with `store` ability if `ledger::mint_points` requires a `T: store`.
        *   Alternatively, if `ledger::mint_points` has specific logic for `stake_opt: option::none()`, ensure that path handles the generic `T` appropriately without needing a "real" `StakePosition<T>`.
    *   **Impact:** Ensures type safety and conceptual correctness for points minted not directly from a user's stake.

**Priority 3: Code Clarity & Housekeeping**

6.  **`stake_position.move` - Weight Calculation Consolidation**
    *   **Task:** (Recommendation) Modify `stake_position::calculate_weight` to accept `liq_share` and perform the full weight calculation: `sqrt(principal) * sqrt(stake_secs) / (1 + liq_share)`.
    *   Update `ledger::enforce_weight_curve` to call this consolidated function.
    *   Remove the now-unused, incomplete `calculate_weight` if the new one replaces it.
    *   **Impact:** Improves code clarity and maintainability.

7.  **`lz_bridge.move` - Feature Gating Decision**
    *   **Task:**
        *   If `lz_bridge` is to be used: uncomment `#[feature(flags)]`, add `lz_bridge = []` to `Move.toml` under `[features]`, and ensure it's conditionally compiled.
        *   If deprecated for Alpha4: Remove `entry` from its public functions or make them private to prevent usage.
    *   **Impact:** Clarifies the status and availability of the LZ bridge functionality.

8.  **General Cleanup (Post-Functional Fixes)**
    *   Remove unnecessary trailing semicolons added as parser workarounds in `integration.move`.
    *   Address unused `mut` warnings (e.g., `supply_oracle` in `integration.move` helper function signature if it's not mutated).
    *   Address other legitimate warnings from the build output (duplicate aliases, unused variables/fields in other files).
    *   **Impact:** Code hygiene and reduced noise in build output.

**Tracking Progress:**
- [x] Item 1: `oracle.move` - `is_stale`
- [x] Item 2: `partner.move` - Collateral & Quota Init (dependent `oracle::price_in_usdc` also fixed)
- [ ] Item 3: `ledger.move` - `liq_share` (Reviewed - currently uses hardcoded 0 from integration module; dynamic source TBD)
- [x] Item 4a: `ledger.move` - `SupplyOracle` epoch tracking
- [-] Item 4b: `ledger.move` - `SupplyOracle.redeem_rate` role (Reviewed - update mechanism aligns with plan; usage in redemption functions TBD)
- [x] Item 5: `integration.move` - `StakePosition<u8>` (Reviewed - current use of `StakePosition<u8>` with `option::none()` is acceptable as `enforce_weight_curve` handles the `none` case)
- [x] Item 6: `stake_position.move` - Weight Calc Consolidation
- [x] Item 7: `lz_bridge.move` - Feature Gating (Entry points removed to disable for Alpha4)
- [~] Item 8: General Cleanup (Trailing semicolons in `integration.move` removed; other warnings like unused `mut` to be addressed after next build output)

Test Plan & Sui Move Test Plan

1. **Test Plan Overview**
   - All business logic, guardrails, and new features (PartnerCap, MintStats, SupplyOracle, weight curve, quotas, caps, epoch rollover, error codes) must be covered by integration, ledger, and loan tests.
   - All test helpers must use up-to-date function signatures and mock objects as needed.
   - Tests must be written in correct Move syntax and pass on Sui v1.0 (Move 2024.alpha).
   - Test outputs are stored in `build_output.txt` for review and remediation.

2. **Sui Move Test Plan**
   - Run `sui move build` on the package after every major change.
   - Store the output in `sources/build_output.txt`.
   - Review the output for any Errors or Failures.
   - Remediate all errors by updating source or test files, referencing:
     - https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript/sui-client
     - https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript/bcs
     - https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript/migrations/sui-1.0
     - https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript/transaction-building/basics
     - https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript/utils
   - Repeat the test/remediation loop until `build_output.txt` reports no Errors.

3. **Feedback Loop**
   - After each test run, read `build_output.txt`.
   - If Errors are present, prioritize fixing them before any further feature work.
   - Document each remediation step in this file for audit traceability.

4. **Success Criteria**
   - All tests pass with no Errors in `build_output.txt`.
   - All business logic and guardrails are covered by tests.
   - Code and tests are fully aligned with the latest Sui SDK and Move best practices.

________________

## Test Error Summary (Latest Pass)

- **Error Count:** Multiple blocking errors (plus many warnings)
- **High-Level Summary:**
    - Unbound type errors: `MintStats`, `SupplyOracle`, and `stake_position::StakePosition` are not imported or referenced correctly in test files (e.g., ledger_tests.move).
    - Too many or too few arguments: Test helper calls (e.g., `test_spend`, `test_earn`) do not match the updated function signatures in the main modules.
    - Unbound module member errors: Test code calls functions or types that are not imported or have changed location.
    - Unbound variable errors: Variables like `mint_stats` are referenced before being defined or imported.
    - Unexpected token errors: Syntax issues in Move source files (e.g., `mut_right` in stake_position.move).
    - Many warnings for unused/duplicate imports, unused variables, and unused constants in test and source files.

- **Next Steps:**
    - Update all test files to import types and modules correctly (e.g., `MintStats`, `SupplyOracle`, `StakePosition`).
    - Update all test helper calls to match the new function signatures and argument counts.
    - Remove or update references to types or functions that no longer exist or have changed.
    - Clean up unused/duplicate imports and variables to reduce warnings.

(Updated after test run on: [latest test run])
